Cross-platform Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances (SID) monitor

Objectives
----------
Monitoring the Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances (SID) is an easy yet exciting Home Based Radio Astronomy Project. This project is an implementation of [Standford][].

The default SuperSID project uses a PC on Windows OS to record the pre-amplified signal received by the antenna with a “SuperSID Monitor”. 

This *supersid* project is a similar but simpler implementation on Linux whithout the “SuperSID Monitor”. This *supersid* includes a text mode which allows to turn your Raspberry Pi in a SID monitor (tested on Raspbian Wheezy & Fedora mix distro).
